hotki is a macOS-only hotkey key application.

Hanging tests are a risk in this project, but our smoketests and unit tests can
both take more than 60 seconds to run. Run these commands with extended
timeouts.

Note that as a macOS-only app, there's no need for conditional compilation for
platform-specific code.

# Testing

After any UI-related changes, run the following smoketest:

```bash
cargo run --bin smoketest -- all
```
