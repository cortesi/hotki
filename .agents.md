hotki is a macOS-only hotkey key application.

Hanging tests are a major risk in this project, so perfer to run the test suite
and smoketests with a timeout:

```bash
timeout 100s cargo test --all --all-features
```

- Note that as a macOS-only app, there's no need for conditional compilation for platform-specific code.

# Testing

After any UI-related changes, run the following smoketest:

```bash
cargo run --bin smoketest -- all
```
