//! Simple, macOS-only permission checks for Hotki.
//!
//! This crate exposes a minimal, stable API to query whether the process has
//! the required Accessibility and Input Monitoring permissions. It calls into
//! the respective macOS frameworks and returns booleans that the UI can act on.
//! There is no prompting logic here: the host is responsible for guiding the
//! user to System Settings if permissions are missing.
//!
//! Notes
//! - `accessibility_ok()` checks the global Accessibility permission.
//! - `input_monitoring_ok()` checks Input Monitoring (listening to keyboard).
//! - `check_permissions()` returns both as a simple status struct.
//!
//! All calls are fast and sideâ€‘effect free.
