# mac-keycode

mac-keycode is a small, macOS-only library that exposes the system’s virtual
keyboard keys and modifiers in a convenient, type-safe way. It provides a
generated enum of all keys, a simple way to convert to and from human-friendly
“spec” strings (including common aliases), and helpers for working with
modifier keys. The key set is derived from the macOS SDK so values stay
faithful to the platform.

See the crate documentation for full details and examples.
