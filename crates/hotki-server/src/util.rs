/// Bridge a crossbeam channel to a Tokio unbounded channel using a dedicated OS
/// thread.
///
/// Semantics
/// - Single consumer: the returned `UnboundedReceiver<T>` has singleâ€‘consumer
///   semantics. Only one task may receive from it.
/// - Backpressure: the Tokio side is unbounded. If the receiver is slow, items
///   accumulate in memory. The bridge never blocks on forwarding; it only
///   blocks when waiting for the next item from the crossbeam receiver.
/// - Closure and drop: the bridge thread forwards until either side closes. If
///   the Tokio receiver is dropped, forwarding fails and the thread exits. If
///   all crossbeam senders are dropped, `recv` returns an error, the thread
///   exits, and the Tokio receiver is closed after all forwarded items are
///   observed.
