//! Internal hotkey server integration for Hotki.
//!
//! This crate provides a thin server/client layer around the core engine to
//! manage global hotkeys and communicate with the Hotki UI process.
//!
//! Public API (internal stability)
//! - `Server`: runs the Tao event loop and hosts the MRPC IPC server.
//! - `Client`: connects to a server; can auto‑spawn a managed server.
//! - `Connection`: typed RPCs and a stream of UI events (`MsgToUI`).
//! - `socket_path_for_pid(pid)`: derives the per‑process socket path.
//!
//! Connection lifecycle and conventions
//! - Per‑process socket path: The default socket path is derived from the
//!   current UID and process ID. Each UI instance owns its own server; do not
//!   assume a global singleton. To coordinate between processes, pass an
//!   explicit socket path.
//! - Auto‑spawn: `Client` can launch the current binary in `--server` mode and
//!   propagate `RUST_LOG`. The parent UI PID is exported via `HOTKI_PARENT_PID`
//!   so the backend exits immediately if the UI process terminates.
//! - Idle shutdown: After the last client disconnects, the server starts an
//!   idle timer (configurable; defaults to a few seconds) and exits when it
//!   fires. A new client connection cancels the timer.
//! - Event stream: Upon connection the server forwards log messages and UI
//!   events (`MsgToUI`) to all clients. A lightweight heartbeat is sent at a
//!   fixed interval to signal liveness.
//!
//! World read path and forwarding
//! - The engine embeds and drives the `hotki-world` service; it is the sole
//!   source of truth for window/focus state on macOS.
//! - There is no engine‑side CG/AX fallback or separate focus watcher.
//! - The server forwards `WorldEvent`s to clients and exposes RPCs for world
//!   snapshots and status. Clients should use the snapshot on reconnect and
//!   then resume streaming.
//! - Permission state (AX/Input Monitoring/Screen Recording) is surfaced via
//!   `WorldStatus` and should be presented in the UI as actionable guidance.
//!
//! Errors and user guidance
//! - If world initialization encounters missing permissions or backpressure,
//!   the server emits notifications and status fields to guide the user. On
//!   macOS this commonly means granting Accessibility, Input Monitoring, and
//!   Screen Recording permissions in System Settings.
